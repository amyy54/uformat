NAME
----
uformat - Universal formatter for keeping formats consistent within a project.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*uformat* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
uformat utilizes the format settings file contained in the current
working directory named *.uformat.json*, and formats the project
according to those rules. Should this file not exist, one final check
is made to check the user's home directory for a file of the same name.

OPTIONS
-------
*-config*='CONFIG_FILE'::
    Sets the path to the configuration file, overriding the checks in
    both the current working directory and the home directory of the user.

*-directory*='FORMAT_DIR'::
    Sets the directory to execute from, overriding the default setting
    to execute off of the current working directory.

*-file*='FORMAT_FILE'::
    Instead of formatting an entire directory, only format a single
    file. The directory option can still be used to format a file in a
    relative path from that directory, but it is not recommended as it
    can cause some odd behaviors. The directory option also still
    remains relevant for options like diff formatting or file
    identification.

*-diff*::
    Rather than running the formatters on the files, create temp files
    to execute formats onto instead. Then, create a diff of the two
    files and display it in standard output. The temporary files are
    deleted once the diff is generated. Overrides *-show* and
    *-show-abs*.

*-ignore-git*::
    Ignore all git related functions. Notably, git is consulted on
    whether a file or folder is ignored by default. Should this option
    be supplied, this check will no longer run.

*-show*::
    Rather than showing the default message displaying the count of
    formatted files, print the file names and their *relative paths*
    compared to the current working directory.

*-show-abs*::
    Like *-show*, but prints the *absolute paths* of the files.

*-list*::
    Load the configuration file (either the default paths using the
    logic described above or a file passed with **-config**) and
    display the format rules found in the file.

*-version*::
    Print the version and exit.

*-v[v]*::
    Verbose logging.
